Jump King RPC (or in short, JKRPC) is a Rich Presence client for Jump King. JKRPC shows the in-game live data on your Discord status using Discord's Rich Presence. JKRPC uses presets to show:
- Location of the player
- Story mode chosen
- Jumps, falls, number of sessions, number of attempts
- Time elapsed from the start of the attempt
